It\u0027s just the right size! I\u0027m supporting!\nGiven it\u0027s largish size, perhaps it should come with two minifigures. Then again, it already comes with a drone and there isn\u0027t room for another cockpit, so I think it\u0027s good as is. Just thought I\u0027d throw it out there though. :)\nAwesome rover!","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"5254ddbd-0ef8-4c86-b965-7e900d370cbb","author":"flavio D ","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1420762620","comment":"wow i love space classic! support! #24","user_vote":"2"},{"id":"952b3477-6dcd-4192-9001-bac3f5ce255a","author":"Thelazyninja","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1420767629","comment":"This is so great, it embodies just what I tried to do with my first project, retro classic space is awesome!","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"b25d1001-5887-401f-8840-7be3f7bc82be","author":"radfamily","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1420773111","comment":"Just right!","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"2d6b279d-4847-4b3b-9db8-a09ff7574b66","author":"Rewind31","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1420787863","comment":"love it! great design and concept! as posted by someone else, an additional small base to go with would make it perfect!","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"990a213d-198e-47a6-bbf7-b38c7dfe60d6","author":"Owenbrendan","replies_count":"1","created_at":"1420812691","comment":"Nice work! #39","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"562af71e-a557-40a3-96ad-460c2361a646","author":"3fim","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1420830462","comment":"im the 40th supporter whooo i hope this becomes a set","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"170147fe-e996-4785-9955-f92155a47ac4","author":"spectralsight","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1420901192","comment":"Great spin on the classic Space theme!","user_vote":"1"},{"id":"2ea0e550-bdfa-4ee3-8304-9d1d17a196f2","author":"Corban2011","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1421508065","comment":"Wow!
