Thank you so much for supporting!\n\nI am still working on the second version of the gingerbread house (the version that looks almost the same, but is loads easier to build and is less part consuming). The LDD design is nearly finished... I will post it again of course in a new update. I am still unsure whether to build the second version for real both because some parts I used in LDD do not yet exist in those specific colors (or are too expensive at the moment to buy) and because I am preoccupied with designing and building fantasy and theme park lego. \n\nOne thing I can say is that I don\u0027t have a design for the interior (as requested by some), basically because originally it was not intended as a play set, but more as a decoration with lights in it. Maybe I will make another gingerbread house later on this year (when my brains are going to itch again for Christmas) in a totally new style with interior. Time will tell.","user_vote":"5"},{"id":"33532bb1-6e84-42b3-aec2-ddbf8905bab1","author":"creativelyme","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1425323832","comment":"so cool! love all the details!!!","user_vote":"4"},{"id":"8b1ba15d-e1a4-4f26-993f-14c8bff677e0","author":"lego__lady","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1425350453","comment":"ohhh, nicely done!","user_vote":"3"},{"id":"d0c0d645-aa70-4778-9968-09b6f46be354","author":"MichielsMum","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1425623394","comment":"Great new update, Swan Dutchman!

I am working on an update hoping to give the project a boost during the Christmas season.\n\nEarlier on I said in the comments section I would try to make an interior. I have been trying a couple of things, but somehow it just looks awkward with an interior, because the scale doesn\u0027t match. The set was designed with the idea of making it as close as possible as a real baked cookie house that you can build with the family. Thus, I decided to abandon the idea of an interior.\n\nCurrently I am collecting all the necessary parts to make a twist on the set. I want to show that with just a few changes of shapes and colors (in other words a few different parts) the house gets a completely different look even though it\u0027s the same shape (well, almost the same). I will try to post it on 1 December when the proejct is 1 year old.","user_vote":"5"},{"id":"d344cf90-314e-4de5-bf81-464a70671789","author":"lmoravec","replies_count":"0","created_at":"1443197851","comment":"The candy canes are the kicker!
