Pictures to help the players accurately construct the plants/flowers. Design the frames that go inside the hives. Frames contain pollen, bee babies, honey, and adult bees. Show the different type of bees. Workers, drones and especially the queen bee, give her a crown!. This set is extremely basic and does not lend much depth as to how bees live and what their food needs are. This would take some work and could be done accurately. Great time to do it as Pres. Obama has an initiative in Congress to support pollinators right now.Redesign this set with more in depth instruction in the kit\u0027s development and the advertising is already in the works. This could be a marvelous educational tool for children and their parents. In it\u0027s current form it is too simple and lacks the parts for a child to play with it for any length of time. This would be for a very young child. Take it to upper elementary level. There is so much potential here that has not been tapped into. Kids love to learn, but today\u0027s children are harder to challenge.","user_vote":"0"}]
